## AKA Sliced Diagrams
Another family of charts, the aggregation charts accumulate the value at a data point across the multiple datasets.

**The data format stays the same.**

## Pie chart
Perhaps the most well-known representation of data slices are Pie charts:

```js

```


## Percentage Charts FTW

Pies have received some [criticism]() for data perception; we are much better at parsing sizes in a single dimension rather than an area. That's why, the much leaner `percentage` chart can come in handy:

```js
type: 'percentage'
```

## Limiting the slices
When there are too many to make sense
